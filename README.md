# Sailor Engine

**Sailor Engine** is a high-performance game engine prototype with a bindless graphics renderer based on `Vulkan 1.3` and efficient multithreading. It features task management, advanced memory allocators, and a data-driven design for modern game development.

Please visit the Wiki to explore the engine's technical design in detail: [**Technical Overview and Details**](https://github.com/aantropov/sailor/wiki).
